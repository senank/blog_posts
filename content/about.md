I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with a B.Sc. in Cognitive Science and minors in Computer Science and Psychology.

Driven by my interest in technology and politics, I set out to explore cognition and how our tools — especially language — shape our understanding and ability to communicate ideas. My goal is to one day formulize and mechanize these ideas, and push the frontier of our understanding of reasoning and rationality.

I have recently been exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the domain of Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Representations. You can find my article reviews on things related to these files [here](https://senankassem.com/posts).
